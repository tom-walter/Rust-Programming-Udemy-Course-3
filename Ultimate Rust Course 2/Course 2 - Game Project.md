# 3. Game Prototype with Rusty Engine

## 1. Project Overview
* there will be a tutorial section and a development section
* the `rusty_engine` is a wrapper around the `bevy_engine`, a real game engine: https://bevyengine.org/
* the `rust_engine` and tutorials can be found here: https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_engine

## 2. Configuration
* add the `rusty_engine` to the Cargo.toml and then run `cargo build`
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    rusty_engine = "5.2.1"
    ```
* this may take a while, which we can use to download the assets from [here](https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_engine/tree/main/assets) 

## 3. Engine Initialization
* import the `rust_engine` prelude
* create an initial, mutable game object
* compiling this should open an empty window
