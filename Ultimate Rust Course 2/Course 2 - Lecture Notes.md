# 1. Introduction

## 1. Intro to the Course
* this is a hands-on course for practical, everyday Rust knowledge
* the contents includes intermediate concepts like
    * idomatic Rust
    * documentation
    * traits
    * testing
    * error (handling)
    * testing
    * and more
* at the end of the course, we'll build a game prototype with the Rust engine
    * this requires a physical machine with a graphics card

## 2. Exercise Overview
* this course comes with exercises available through [this repo](https://github.com/CleanCut/ultimate_rust2)
* you can clone this repo to do the exercises on your own machine or in a virtual environment with Rust compiler toolchain
* each exercise is a small, standalone Rust project, which will compile and run, if you complete tasks
