# 1. Introduction

## 1. Intro to the Course
* this is a hands-on course for practical, everyday Rust knowledge
* the contents includes intermediate concepts like
    * idomatic Rust
    * documentation
    * traits
    * testing
    * error (handling)
    * testing
    * and more
* at the end of the course, we'll build a game prototype with the Rust engine
    * this requires a physical machine with a graphics card

## 2. Exercise Overview
* this course comes with exercises available through [this repo](https://github.com/CleanCut/ultimate_rust2)
* you can clone this repo to do the exercises on your own machine or in a virtual environment with Rust compiler toolchain
* each exercise is a small, standalone Rust project, which will compile and run, if you complete tasks

# 2. Intermediate Concepts

## 1. Idomatic Rust
### What is "_ideomatic_"?
1. expressions that are natural to a native speaker
2. appropriate to the style of a particular group
* so ideomatic Rust means using it like a daily practitioner or how it is commonly used by the Rust community

### Tools for Ideomatic Rust
* there are 2 main tools for writing ideomatic Rust
1. `rustfmt`
    * it is the de facto Rust style guide
    * can be run with `cargo fmt` command
    * it takes care of indentation, brace-alignment, trailing commas, etc.
    * it can also be configured through a `.rustfmt.toml` file at the root of the project
2. `clippy`
    * checks for over 450 specific problems
    * there are 4 main types of problems
        1. style
        2. correctness
        3. complexity
        4. performance
    * this makes clippy extremly useful
    * checkout all [linting rules](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/)
    * can be run with `cargo clippy` command 

### Attributes
* attributes are code decorators that allow you to modify a function, struct or script with very little code
* they always start with a `#` and are framed by `[]`
* e.g.
    ```rust
    #[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]
    ```

### Exercises
* I used the following commands
    ```
    cargo fmt
    cargo clippy
    cargo clippy --fix --bin exercise_a --allow-staged
    cargo run
    ```
* I manually implemented the suggestions from `clippy` that could not be done automatically

## 2. Documentation
### Generating Documentation 
* documentation is only useful, if it's readable
* Rust can generate a website (html-files) with standardized documentation layout with ` cargo doc`
* but even better is the command `cargo doc --no-deps --open`
    * `--no-deps` will not render documentation for dependencies (only for your code)
    * `--open` will open the index page of the documentation

### Writing Documentation
* there are two styles of documentation
    1. triple slash (per-line style)
    2. double asteriks (block style)
* these are outer doc-strings (for functions, struct and constants)

#### Triple Slash
* each line of a doc-string beginswith 3 slahes `///`
* we want to document the following constant
    ```rust
    /// Number of pieces in the puzzle
    pub const PUZZLE_PIECES: u32 = 42;
    ```
* these doc-strings are always written above the constant or function-signature
* the rendering of doc-string support common **markdown syntax** with headers, bold/italic, links, code snippets, etc.
    * beware that code snippets inside doc-strings must be valid rust
* let's add some infos to our constant:
    ```rust
    /// Number of pieces in the puzzle
    ///
    /// # History
    ///
    /// This is a separate paragraph.
    /// - Clickable link: [`PUZZLE_PIECES`]
    /// - We tried `7`, but this is better ðŸ§©
    pub const PUZZLE_PIECES: u32 = 42;
    ```
* here is another example for a `struct`
    ```rust
    /// This is a puzzle
    pub struct Puzzle {
        /// Number of pieces
        pub num_pieces: u32,
        /// Descriptive name
        pub name: String,
    }
    ```
* and for associated `impl`
    ```rust
    impl Puzzle {
        /// Make a new puzzle
        pub fn new() -> Self {
            Self {
                num_pieces: PUZZLE_PIECES,
                name: "Forest Lake".into(),
            }
        }
    }
    ```

#### Double Asteriks
* we can also write documentation using a multi-line comment style with double asteriks
    ```rust
    /**
    Number of pieces in the puzzle

    # History

    This is a separate paragraph.
    - Clickable link: [`PUZZLE_PIECES`]
    - We tried `7`, but this is better ðŸ§©
    **/
    pub const PUZZLE_PIECES: u32 = 42;
    ```
* the rest of the markdown features are almost the same
* for markdown links
    * any code object in scope of the script can be linked
    * any code object out of scope can be linked with an absolute path
    ```rust
    /// [Spawn a thread](std::thread::spawn)
    ``` 

#### Inner Doc-Strings
* are used to document libraries and modules
* these are constructed with 
    * `//!` for per-line style
    * `/*! !*/` for block style 
* let's write documentation for our puzzle library
    ```rust
    //! HI! I'm a friendly Rust Puzzle Library.
    //!
    //! This is my documentation
    ```
### Exercise
* render the documentation by running `cargo doc --no-deps --open`
* challenge solution
    ```
    cargo doc --help | grep private
      --document-private-items  Document private items
    ```

## 3. Publishing
### Publishing on Crates.io
* [crates.io](www.crates.io) is Rust's community crate registry
* whatever you publish there will be **permanent**
    * don't publish your private credentials, ssh keys, API keys, access tokens, etc.
* package names need to be _unique_ because there is only one global namespace for all crates

Publication Pre-Requisites
1. log into crates.io with you GitHub account
2. goto account settings and generate an access token
3. run `cargo login` using your access token
4. have package that you want to publish

Polishing the `Cargo.toml`
* the `Cargo.toml` has many additional fields that can provide useful information to the users of your crate
* here is an example from the Â´rusty_engineÂ´
    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "rusty_engine"
    version = "6.0.0"
    description = "Learn Rust with a simple, cross-platform, 2D game engine."
    edition = "2021"
    homepage = "https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_engine"
    repository = "https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_engine"
    readme = "README.md"
    keywords = [ "game", "engine", "graphics", "audio", "rusty" ]
    categories = [ "game-engines" ]
    license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"
    ```
    * adding a code `repository` makes it easier for other users to contribute or report issues
    * `keywords` allows a max of 5 SEO-keywords to for better finding your crate on Crates.io
    * `categories` allows a max of 5 _valid category slugs_ from Crates.io

### Publishing
* after the initial setup and after you developed a package, you can publish with `cargo publish`
    ```console
    $ cargo publish --help
    Upload a package to the registry  

    Usage: cargo.exe publish [OPTIONS]

    Options:
    -n, --dry-run              Perform all checks without uploading
        --index <INDEX>        Registry index URL to upload the package to
        --registry <REGISTRY>  Registry to upload the package to
        --token <TOKEN>        Token to use when uploading
    -h, --help                 Print help

    Package Selection:
    -p, --package [<SPEC>]  Package to publish
    ```
* this will re-compile (only publishes if compiled without error), check the versioning, check for un-committed code, etc.
* anything published on Crates.io automatically gets its documentation published online on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/) (for free)

### No Exercise
* there will be no exercise to prevent useless crates from littering Crates.io and limiting the the unique global namespace
* if personal namespacing will be implemented for Crates.io, this section will be updated with an exercise
